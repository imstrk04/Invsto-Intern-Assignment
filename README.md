# MarketMinds

## Description
MarketMinds is a trading strategy implementation that analyzes market data and generates trading signals based on technical indicators like Bollinger Bands. It also calculates cumulative returns based on the generated signals.

## Features
- Calculate Bollinger Bands
- Generate buy/sell signals based on Bollinger Bands
- Calculate market and strategy returns

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- [Any other dependencies your project requires]

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/invsto.git
   cd invsto
   ```

2. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   Or install individual packages if you prefer:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy
   ```

## Usage

1. Prepare your market data in a CSV file or another supported format.
2. Import the required functions in your Python script or Jupyter Notebook:

   ```python
   from trading_strategy import calculate_bollinger_bands, generate_signals, calculate_returns
   ```

3. Load your data into a pandas DataFrame:
   ```python
   import pandas as pd

   data = pd.read_csv('your_data_file.csv')  # Replace with your data file
   ```

4. Calculate Bollinger Bands:
   ```python
   df_with_bands = calculate_bollinger_bands(data, window=20)  # Adjust the window size as needed
   ```

5. Generate trading signals:
   ```python
   df_with_signals = generate_signals(df_with_bands)
   ```

6. Calculate returns:
   ```python
   df_with_returns = calculate_returns(df_with_signals)
   ```

## Testing

To run the tests for this project, make sure you have the necessary test framework installed (e.g., `unittest` is built-in):
